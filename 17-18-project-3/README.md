* Applying what I've learned in data analytics to a real-world data set

# Summary
This presentation explores the evolution of athlete's earnings over three decades, highlighting the top 10 earners and trends in the sports industry. Firstly, I went through a data cleaning process before the code ran, it worked and was not going to cause further errors. I have logically worked through the data set showing the graphs and data points I felt told this story with the most detail.
