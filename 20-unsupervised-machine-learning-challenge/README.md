# <span style="color:tan"> Unit 20 Unsupervised Machine Learning Challenge </span>

In this challenge, you’ll use your knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. The project analyzes the impact of using fewer features on clustering the data using K-means. Comparing the clustering results of the original data and the PCA data helps to understand the effect of dimensionality reduction on the clustering process.
